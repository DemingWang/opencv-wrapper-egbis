OpenCV wrapper for the "egbis" segmentation algorithm
=====================================================
OpenCV wrapper for Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation algorithm developed
by Pedro F. Felzenszwalb and Daniel P. Huttenlocher. This is done as a part of my report about using the Efficient
Graph-Based Image segmentation method to detect roads from Bing maps.

* [My project report here on
  Github](https://github.com/christofferholmstedt/maa507-report-mathematics-behind-internet)
* [Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation
  algorithm](http://cs.brown.edu/~pff/segment/) (I recommend reading the paper)


How to use
----------
This program is tested to work on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Still under early development, will update with instructions when it's done.
